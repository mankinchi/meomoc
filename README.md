This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About
I built this in order to learn more about how Next & Vercel works with its serverless feature. You can check read about my experience [`here`](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-first-experience-nextjs-serverless-tri-nguyen)

What this app does is hook into facebook to keep track of changes made to the page. It will then save all the new post id provided by facebook into its own
database (I used mongodb in this project. But since I use PrismaORM here, you can basically put any database in and it will work).

Stack of choice:
* FE:
	* NextJS
	* FontAwesome Icon
* BE:
	* NextJS
	* PrismaORM
	* MongoDB
* Server:
	* Vercel

You can check the live running demo [`here`](https://meomoc.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
